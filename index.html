        <h2>History of Padel</h2>
        <p>Padel is a racquet sport typically played in doubles on an enclosed court slightly smaller than a tennis court. It was invented in Mexico by Enrique Corcuera in 1969. Since then, it has grown in popularity, especially in Spain and Latin America. The sport combines elements of tennis, squash, and badminton, making it a unique and exciting game.</p>

        <h2>Scoring System</h2>
        <p>The scoring system in padel is the same as in tennis. Matches are usually best of three sets, with each set being won by the first team to win six games with at least a two-game advantage. One of the most memorable matches in padel history was the 2019 World Padel Tour final, where Juan Lebr√≥n and Paquito Navarro triumphed in a thrilling three-set match that kept fans on the edge of their seats.</p>

        <h2>Rules of Padel</h2>
        <p>Padel is played with the same balls as tennis and the scoring is the same. The main differences are that the court has walls and the balls can be played off them in a similar way to squash. The serve is underhand and must bounce once on the ground before hitting it. One of the most exciting aspects of padel is the strategic use of the walls, which can lead to some incredible rallies and spectacular points.</p>
