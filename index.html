        <h2>Scoring System</h2>
        <p>The scoring system in padel is the same as in tennis. Matches are usually best of three sets, with each set being won by the first team to win six games with at least a two-game advantage.</p>

        <h2>Rules of Padel</h2>
        <p>Padel is played with the same balls as tennis and the scoring is the same. The main differences are that the court has walls and the balls can be played off them in a similar way to squash. The serve is underhand and must bounce once on the ground before hitting it.</p>
